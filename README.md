- Visualized and pre-processed a highly imbalanced dataset using Python tools. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and performed Univariate and Bivariate analysis.

- Utilized Machine Learning algorithms such as Logistical Regression, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbours, and performed grid search to identify the optimal set of parameters for the models. Achieved 
  classification recall up to 93%.
   
- Compared the performance of the models based on Fl scores and Confusion Matrix Plotted Roc curves to evaluate the pefomance of the models. Concluded that Logistic Regression was the best classifier based on the 
  analysis of the ROC curves.
